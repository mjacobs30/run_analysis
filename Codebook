The is the codebook for run_analysis.
The original data source and txt files come from the UCI HAR Dataset

The following variables are used in run_analysis.R:

1. testData is used for the dataframe created from the data from x_test.txt
2. testActivity is used for the dataframe created from the data from y_test.txt
3. trainingData is used for the dataframe created from the data from x_train.txt
4. trainingAcitivty is used for the dataframe created from the data from y_train.txt
5. Features is used for the dataframe created from the data from features.txt
6. allActivity describes the combination of data merged from testActivity and trainingActivity (in that order, from top to bottom)
7. testSubset and trainSubset are used for the dataframes that remove all columns in testData and trainingData that do not involve mean or std features
8. allSubjects includes the subject numbers merged from subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt
9. df is the dataframe that combines subjects, activities, and the features from the testSubset and trainSubset
10. df2 is the dataframe that describes the means of each feature for each activity per subject. The writetable function is used with this dataframe.

With these variables, in the run_analysis script I first labeled the test and train data with the corresponding features as the column names.
I then merged all activities into a single dataframe.
I merged and then filtered the test and train data using grep1 across "mean" and "std" mentions in column titles.
I filtered the test and train data before binding with the subject and activities so that the grep1 function would not remove the subject and activity columns.
I added subject numbers and activities using cbind. 
I created df2 using the dplyr library, grouping by subject and activity, and then using summarise_each to get the feature means.
I used the write table function to create the tidyData.txt file.
